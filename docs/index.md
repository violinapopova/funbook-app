## Welcome to FunBook app data sets

On these pages you will find example data for the social media clone app - FunBook. The data included in here is purely a work of fiction and an example of how responses from a real API may look like.

### Dataset list

Each dataset is a representation of what would have been returned by an API endpoint in a real world app.
The datasets included in this repository are:

- a list of all users
- a detailed profile of the main user
- a list of items to be displayed on the main user's home surface
- a list of conversations of the main user
- detail of message exchanges of the main user

As this data is an example it is read-only
